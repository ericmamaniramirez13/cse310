# Overview

My software is very visual since it is an app of 100% java (no kotlin). I focused on a math app since that is something my team and I are currently working on. We want to develop a math app and this basic app is kind of something we want to do but way better. It involves classes and also, android studio resources to make the app work.

# Development Environment

I worked on the andrioid studio environment since it was easier than weking on vscode for the code and android studio for the app. 

I used the next libraries: random, List, and arraylist.
