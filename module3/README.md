# Overview

This software is based on data analisys. I worked on a dataset of the firepower each country has as of 2022. I wanted to see which countries have more power in specific fields like 
who has more tanks, helicopters etc. Also, I wanted to visualize the data resuls by showing graphs of the results.

# Data Analysis Results

Some of the questions I had were:
What countries have more tanks?
What countries have more attack helicopters?
How much of the total population for each country is an acctive personnel?
I got all the snwers in my software and I was very impressed for the results for exmaple I learned that The United Stated is the country with more attacj helicopters and North Korea
is the country with higher proportion of population serving as active personnel.

# Development Environment

I Used Jupyter Notebook, which is very similar to python but with the only difference that here we work in cells where we need to run each cell instead of the whole code at once.
