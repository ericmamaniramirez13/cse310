# Overview

My software is all about customers. There is a part for the customer where they can
manage what they are buying and hoe much they may spend. The other part is about the reviews that customers leave to each location of any business. In this case, I selected Idaho and Utah as the two locations where customers can leave thei reviews to ion the end get an average opf those reviews for each location. Let's imagine that we are talking about TacoBell and according to the customers review the location in Utah was better scored by them.

# Development Environment

I used variables, conditional statements, lists, index, functions, and a class to make my software run properly. There were many things that I was able to apply for example the class Customer which took me more time to run without bugs. It was interesting to see how helpful can be having your code with a class that can make easier the way you code.
