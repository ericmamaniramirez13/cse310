# Overview

This software is mainly about Database using MySQL Workbench.

I based my software on the idea of students getting a scholarship since I applied about a few weeks ago. There is interesting data for students to look at and decide if he/she will get one.

The main purpose of my software is to distinguish those students that do not really need a scholarship and those who really need financial aid.

# Relational Database

I created three tables: student, salary, and performance.}
{These three tables are related in a one-to-many relationship since a student can have only one salary and salary can only have one student, the same goes for the performance table. A students can have one one performance(GPA, Credits_num), but performance can have multiple students For example, three students having the same GPA 3.5.

# Development Environment

For the development environment I used MySQL Workbench since is a free software to use.

I used a diagram model to create my table and columns adding primary keys and foreign keys.

# Future Work

Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.
* Even though the data I careted is not based on real data I should have tried to add more common data For example, not married people are not likely to ahve 5 or 6 children.
* Probably I can add more tables for next projects to play with more data.
