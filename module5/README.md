# Overview

{This game takes includes: }
*User Interface including Graphics and Sound
*Event Processing (Keyboard)
*Notifications(Winner)
{There are two spaceships so this can be considered a game of two players. The purpose of the game is to hit the enemy player with a gun that the spaceship fires. The commands for player1: a,w,d,s for movement and left control for fire. The comands for player2: arrows for movement and right control for fire.}

{I always wanted to learn the basics of creating a game and this was a great opportunity wher I learned to create the base interface for a game from creating the window interface to give the objects funtionality.}

# Future Work
* I want to add moore functions like steroids moving around the game.
* Something to improve can be the health or life for each spaceship and change it to a bar that indicates the health instead of a counter of 10 hits.
